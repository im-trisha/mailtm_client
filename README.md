## Introduction
This package is a simple but complete mail.tm api wrapper, you can use this to save and manage your accounts, as well read all your temporary emails.

## Example
See in [the example folder](example/)

## Usage

### MailTm 
A static class which is mainly needed for storing, creating and loading accounts, you can load all accounts in a session by saving them with getAuths and loading them with loadAuths

#### Create an account


[Go to Account section](#account)


To create an account you just need to use the MailTm.register method.

Params

- randomStringLength: will be used to generate a random password and/or username if not provided (10 is the default length)

- username: address' username (abcdqwerty@mail.tm, here, abcdqwerty is the username)
- password: account's password

- domain: address' domain, (like @mail.tm, must be [Domain](#domain) class), if not provided, a random one will be provided.

``await MailTm.register(password: 'ah yes password');``

Returns the ``Future<TMAccount>`` instance (Must be awaited as above!)

#### Loading an account

[Go to Account section](#account)

You can load an account by using the MailTm.login method

If you provide the id and it is present in the saved accounts it will return the saved account instance (Useful if you don't want to make another api request)

If you don't, and you provide address and password it will retrieve the account from the api's

If nothing is provided/the provided parameters are not valid and elseNew is true a new account will be returned (Default true)

If nothing is provided and elseNew is false, throws MailError with code -1 (Invalid arguments)
