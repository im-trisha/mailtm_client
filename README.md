### MailTm class


#### Initiation

To start, you need to instanciate the client, it can accept 2 parameters, ``canSave``, a bool that tells the class if it can save the accounts that will be created.

And ``customDb``, a File, that, if ``canSave`` is true, will be used as custom db to store files, or else it will use a defaut directory ``%home%/.dartmailtm``

``MailTm client = await MailTm.init(canSave: false);``

If you don't need a database, and you don't want to use async/await, you can just

``MailTm(canSave: false)``

[Go to Account section](#accounts)

Creates an account, if you want, you can also provide a password! (Or not)

``await client.createAccount(password:'ah yes password');``

Returns the ``Account`` instance


#### Save an account to the local database

Saves the ``Account`` instance to the database

``client.saveAccount(account);``

#### Load an account

You can load an account from the local database (you can specify the index) by doing this

or the id, address and password, and load from API

You could also use ``await account.delete()`` if you don't want to delete it from the local database.
